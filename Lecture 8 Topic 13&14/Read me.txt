This interactive lecture session helps you understand the randomized controlled trials (RCT) and difference-in-difference (DiD) tests. 
Both of tests are important in determining causal inference in finance.

Randomized controlled trials: 
1. Assign samples to control group and treatment group randomly.
2. Give treatment effect to treatment group but give placebo to control group.
3. Compare the difference in outcome.

Difference-in-difference tests:
1. Identify one exogenous shock that randomly affects one small group (treatment group) but not affect others (controll group).
2. Calculate difference between two groups before the schock.
3. Calculate difference between two groups after the shock.
4. Calculate difference in difference.
